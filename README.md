# Xiawave Node Chat - In Development

Feel free to try out this little stuff, any feedback would be good to improve this product.

Some known bugs:
- The text editor does not refresh its content, unless it has focus.
- You can't delete not empty folder. You can only delete an empty folder ( now ).


You can launch the app with

```
node index.js
```
